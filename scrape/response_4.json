        "abstract": "Solving the challenge of occupancy prediction is crucial in order to design efficient and sustainable office spaces and automate lighting, heating, and air circulation in these facilities. In office spaces where large areas need to be observed, multiple sensors must be used for full coverage. In these cases, it is normally important to keep the costs low, but also to make sure that the privacy of the people who use such environments are preserved. Low-cost and low-resolution heat (thermal) sensors can be very useful to build solutions that address these concerns. However, they are extremely sensitive to noise artifacts which might be caused by heat prints of the people who left the space or by other objects, which are either using electricity or exposed to sunlight. There are some earlier solutions for occupancy prediction that employ low-resolution heat sensors; however, they have not addressed nor compensated for such heat artifacts. Therefore, in this paper, we presented a low-cost and low-energy consuming smart space implementation to predict the number of people in the environment based on whether their activity is static or dynamic in time. We used a low-resolution <inline-formula><math display=\"inline\"><semantics><mrow><mo>(</mo><mn>8</mn><mo>\u00d7</mo><mn>8</mn><mo>)</mo></mrow></semantics></math></inline-formula> and non-intrusive heat sensor to collect data from an actual meeting room. We proposed two novel workflows to predict the occupancy; one that is based on computer vision and one based on machine learning. Besides comparing the advantages and disadvantages of these different workflows, we used several state-of-the-art explainability methods in order to provide a detailed analysis of the algorithm parameters and how the image properties influence the resulting performance. Furthermore, we analyzed noise resources that affect the heat sensor data. The experiments show that the feature classification based method gives high accuracy when the data are clean from noise artifacts. However, when there are noise artifacts, the computer vision based method can compensate for those artifacts providing robust results. Because the computer vision based method requires an empty room recording, the feature classification based method should be chosen either when there is no expectancy of seeing noise artifacts in the data or when there is no empty recording available. We hope that our analysis brings light into understanding how to handle very low-resolution heat images in these environments. The presented workflows could be used in various domains and applications other than smart offices, where occupancy prediction is essential, e.g., for elderly care.",

        "abstract": "With the advent of robust deep learning, neural machine translation (NMT) has achieved great progress and recently become the dominant paradigm in machine translation (MT). However, it is still confronted with the challenge of word ambiguities that force NMT to choose among several translation candidates that represent different senses of an input word. This research presents a case study using Korean word sense disambiguation (WSD) to improve NMT performance. First, we constructed a Korean lexical semantic network (LSN) as a large-scale lexical semantic knowledge base. Then, based on the Korean LSN, we built a Korean WSD preprocessor that can annotate the correct sense of Korean words in the training corpus. Finally, we conducted a series of translation experiments using Korean-English, Korean-French, Korean-Spanish, and Korean-Japanese language pairs. The experimental results show that our Korean WSD system can significantly improve the translation quality of NMT in terms of the BLEU, TER, and DLRATIO metrics. On average, it improved the precision by 2.94 BLEU points and improved translation error prevention by 4.04 TER points and 4.51 DLRATIO points for all the language pairs.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The existing static voltage stability margin evaluation methods cannot meet the actual demand of current power grid well in terms of calculation speed and accuracy. Thus, this paper proposes a static voltage stability margin prediction method based on a graph attention network (GAT) and a long short\u2010term memory network (LSTM) to predict the static voltage stability margin of a power system accurately, fast, and effectively, considering new energy uncertainty. First, an innovative machine learning framework named the GAT\u2010LSTM is designed to extract highly representative power grid operation features considering the spatial\u2010temporal correlation of the power grid operation. Then, a static voltage stability margin prediction method based on the GAT\u2010LSTM is developed. Particularly, considering the influence of new energy power uncertainty, two loss functions of certainty and uncertainty are used in the proposed method to predict the voltage stability margin and voltage fluctuation range. Finally, the IEEE39\u2010bus power system and a practical power system are employed to verify the proposed method. The results show that the computational speed of the proposed method is greatly improved compared to the traditional methods not based on machine learning; the computation results are more accurate and reliable than the existing machine learning methods. Compared with the existing methods, the proposed method has higher scalability and applicability.",

        "abstract": "As the popularity of electric vehicles (EVs) and smart grids continues to rise, so does the demand for batteries. Within the landscape of battery-powered energy storage systems, the battery management system (BMS) is crucial. It provides key functions such as battery state estimation (including state of charge, state of health, battery safety, and thermal management) as well as cell balancing. Its primary role is to ensure safe battery operation. However, due to the limited memory and computational capacity of onboard chips, achieving this goal is challenging, as both theory and practical evidence suggest. Given the immense amount of battery data produced over its operational life, the scientific community is increasingly turning to cloud computing for data storage and analysis. This cloud-based digital solution presents a more flexible and efficient alternative to traditional methods that often require significant hardware investments. The integration of machine learning is becoming an essential tool for extracting patterns and insights from vast amounts of observational data. As a result, the future points towards the development of a cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced BMS. This will notably improve the predictive and modeling capacity for long-range connections across various timescales, by combining the strength of physical process models with the versatility of machine learning techniques.",

        "abstract": "This work describes an experimental and machine learning approach for the prediction of selenite removal on chemically modified zeolite for water treatment. Breakthrough curves were constructed using iron-coated zeolite adsorbent and the adsorption behavior was evaluated as a function of an initial contaminant concentration as well as the ionic strength. An elevated selenium concentration in water threatens human health and aquatic life. The migration of this metalloid from the contaminated sites and the problems associated with its high releases into the water has become a major environmental concern. The mobility of this emerging metalloid in the contaminated water prompted the development of an efficient, cost-effective adsorbent for its removal. Selenite <inline-formula><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mo>[</mo><mrow><mi>Se</mi><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mi>IV</mi></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow><mo>]</mo></mrow></mrow></semantics></math></inline-formula> removal from aqueous solutions was studied in laboratory-scale continuous and packed-bed adsorption columns using iron-coated natural zeolite adsorbents. The proposed adsorbent combines iron oxide and natural zeolite\u2019s ability to bind contaminants. Breakthrough curves were initially obtained under variable experimental conditions, including the change in the initial concentration of <inline-formula><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>Se</mi><mtext>\u00a0</mtext></mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mi>IV</mi></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></semantics></math></inline-formula>, and the ionic strength of solutions. Investigating the effect of these parameters will enhance selenite mobility retardation in contaminated water. Continuous adsorption experiment findings will evaluate the efficiency of this economical and naturally-based adsorbent for selenite removal and fate in water. Multilinear and non-linear regressions approaches were utilized, yet low coefficients of determination values were respectively obtained. Then, a comparative analysis of five boosted regression tree algorithms for a selenite breakthrough curve prediction was performed.

This work proposes implementing machine learning-based approaches for predicting water remediation-associated processes.

        "abstract": "The steering mechanism of ship steering gear is generally driven by a hydraulic system. The precise control of the hydraulic cylinder in the steering mechanism can be achieved by the target rudder angle. However, hydraulic systems are often described as nonlinear systems with uncertainties. Since the system parameters are uncertain and system performances are influenced by disturbances and noises, the robustness cannot be satisfied by approximating the nonlinear theory by a linear theory. In this paper, a learning-based model predictive controller (LB-MPC) is designed for the position control of an electro-hydraulic cylinder system. In order to reduce the influence of uncertainty of the hydraulic system caused by the model mismatch, the Gaussian process (GP) is adopted, and also the real-time input and output data are used to improve the model. A comparative simulation of GP-MPC and MPC is performed assuming that the interference and uncertainty terms are bounded. Consequently, the proposed control strategy can effectively improve the piston position quickly and precisely with multiple constraint conditions.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background Severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) are the most common infectious causes of death. Previous work regarding mortality prediction models for SARI using machine learning (ML) algorithms that can be useful for both individual risk stratification and quality of care assessment is scarce. We aimed to develop reliable models for mortality prediction in SARI patients utilizing ML algorithms and compare its performances with a classic regression analysis approach. Methods Administrative data (dataset randomly split 75%/25% for model training/testing) from years 2016\u20132019 of 86 German Helios hospitals was retrospectively analyzed. Inpatient SARI cases were defined by ICD-codes J09-J22. Three ML algorithms were evaluated and its performance compared to generalized linear models (GLM) by computing receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC) and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC). Results The dataset contained 241,988 inpatient SARI cases (75\u00a0years or older: 49%; male 56.2%). In-hospital mortality was 11.6%. AUC and AUPRC in the testing dataset were 0.83 and 0.372 for GLM, 0.831 and 0.384 for random forest (RF), 0.834 and 0.382 for single layer neural network (NNET) and 0.834 and 0.389 for extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). Statistical comparison of ROC AUCs revealed a better performance of NNET and XGBoost as compared to GLM. Conclusion ML algorithms for predicting in-hospital mortality were trained and tested on a large real-world administrative dataset of SARI patients and showed good discriminatory performances. Broad application of our models in clinical routine practice can contribute to patients\u2019 risk assessment and quality management.",

        "abstract": "Automatic vision-based inspection systems have played a key role in product quality assessment for decades through the segmentation, detection, and classification of defects. Historically, machine learning frameworks, based on hand-crafted feature extraction, selection, and validation, counted on a combined approach of parameterized image processing algorithms and explicated human knowledge. The outstanding performance of deep learning (DL) for vision systems, in automatically discovering a feature representation suitable for the corresponding task, has exponentially increased the number of scientific articles and commercial products aiming at industrial quality assessment. In such a context, this article reviews more than 220 relevant articles from the related literature published until February 2023, covering the recent consolidation and advances in the field of fully-automatic DL-based surface defects inspection systems, deployed in various industrial applications. The analyzed papers have been classified according to a bi-dimensional taxonomy, that considers both the specific defect recognition task and the employed learning paradigm. The dependency on large and high-quality labeled datasets and the different neural architectures employed to achieve an overall perception of both well-visible and subtle defects, through the supervision of fine or/and coarse data annotations have been assessed. The results of our analysis highlight a growing research interest in defect representation power enrichment, especially by transferring pre-trained layers to an optimized network and by explaining the network decisions to suggest trustworthy retention or rejection of the products being evaluated.",

The software developed by pycharm and python programming language was used to compile automatically a software to identify whether the required items were filled out. And on the basis of completing the software, it is connected to the embedded device high-speed clapper. It is applied to Fuzhou Customs to help the customs staff review the health form and declaration card of inbound and outbound passengers, which not only saves the time of staff and passengers, but also contributes to the prevention and control of epidemic situation to a certain extent.",

        "abstract": "Full information about a many-body quantum system is usually out-of-reach due to the exponential growth\u2014with the size of the system\u2014of the number of parameters needed to encode its state. Nonetheless, in order to understand the complex phenomenology that can be observed in these systems, it is often sufficient to consider dynamical or stationary properties of local observables or, at most, of few-body correlation functions. These quantities are typically studied by singling out a specific subsystem of interest and regarding the remainder of the many-body system as an effective bath. In the simplest scenario, the subsystem dynamics, which is in fact an open quantum dynamics, can be approximated through Markovian quantum master equations. Here, we formulate the problem of finding the generator of the subsystem dynamics as a variational problem, which we solve using the standard toolbox of machine learning for optimization. This dynamical or \u2018Lindblad\u2019 generator provides the relevant dynamical parameters for the subsystem of interest. Importantly, the algorithm we develop is constructed such that the learned generator implements a physically consistent open quantum time-evolution. We exploit this to learn the generator of the dynamics of a subsystem of a many-body system subject to a unitary quantum dynamics. We explore the capability of our method to recover the time-evolution of a two-body subsystem and exploit the physical consistency of the generator to make predictions on the stationary state of the subsystem dynamics.",
